## Open movie Code Challenge
This application display 1 season + all episodes of a series of choice using the [API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Setup Instructions
To get started, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies
3. Create an environment file (.env.local and add api key as `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Technologies Used
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwindcss
- Keen Slider

## Conclusion
The project meets all of the requirements specified in the assessment. More features could be added:
- If I had more time, I could have developed the episodes section myself instead of using Keen Slider
- I could have written a Tailwind theme, but unfortunately, the design didn't follow a specific pattern
- I could have written some unit tests for the UI if I had more time
